## FAQ Section

### Frequently Asked Questions

**How accurate is the email verification?**
Our verification achieves 95%+ accuracy through multi-step validation: syntax check, domain verification, MX records, SMTP authentication, and catch-all detection.

**What's a catch-all domain?**
A catch-all domain accepts emails sent to ANY address @domain.com. These are risky because we can't verify if the specific mailbox exists. We flag these so you can decide whether to include them.

**Do you store the emails I verify?**
No. We process and verify your emails but don't store them. All data is deleted after 30 days. We're GDPR compliant and SOC 2 certified.

**Can I verify emails in real-time on my website?**
Yes! Our API allows real-time verification as users enter emails. Prevent fake signups and reduce bounces by 90%.

**What happens to invalid emails?**
We categorize each email as Valid, Invalid, Catch-all, or Unknown. You can export only valid emails or flag risky ones for manual review.

**Do you integrate with my CRM?**
Yes! We have one-click integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, and Zoho. Custom integrations available for Enterprise plans.

**What's your refund policy?**
We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied, we'll refund 100% of your payment, no questions asked.

**Can I cancel anytime?**

## The Problem

### Why Real Estate Lead Generation Is Broken

**Traditional methods are expensive and outdated:**
- Lead brokers charge $10-50 per lead (often low quality)
- Buying email lists gets you outdated contacts
- Cold calling takes 100+ calls for one conversation
- LinkedIn prospecting is time-consuming and gets you blocked

**The result?** You waste money on bad leads and hours on manual research.

**There's a better way.** WebLeads gives you fresh, verified real estate leads extracted directly from Google Maps. Same data the brokers use, but you control it.

### Get Real Estate Leads in 3 Steps

**Step 1: Search by Location & Criteria**
- Search "real estate agents in Austin, TX"
- Filter by rating, reviews, years in business

**Step 3: Export & Start Outreach**

I help agents like you get 20-30 pre-qualified buyer leads per month through [describe your service].

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call this week to see if it's a fit?

## Strategy 11: Buy Leads from Brokers (Last Resort)

### When to Buy Real Estate Leads

**Reality check:** Buying leads should be your LAST option, not your first.

**Average costs:**
- Zillow leads: $20-60 per lead
- Realtor.com leads: $15-45 per lead
- BoldLeads: $300-800/month
- Market Leader: $300-500/month

**Problems:**
- Shared leads (you compete with 3-5 other buyers)
- Low quality (many unqualified)
- Expensive (10-100X more than self-generation)
- No control over lead flow

**When it makes sense:**
- You have no time to generate your own
- You have high conversion rates (>10%)
- You can afford $30-50 per conversation

**Better alternative:** Spend that $500/month on WebLeads + tools and generate 5,000+ leads yourself.
