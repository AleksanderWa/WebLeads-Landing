### 6. Map Lead Scraper (Why So Cheap?)
**Website**: https://www.mapleadscraper.com/
**Type**: Chrome extension
**Founded**: N/A

#### Pricing Analysis
Map Lead Scraper appears "cheap" at $9.90-$19.90/month for 1,000-100,000 leads, but this is misleading for several reasons:

#### Why Map Lead Scraper Pricing Seems Low
1. **Limited Scope**: Only scrapes basic Google Maps data (name, phone, address, website)
2. **No Advanced Features**: No email extraction, social media, reviews, ratings analysis
3. **Chrome Extension Limitations**: Can only run in browser, limited scalability
4. **Basic Filtering**: No advanced search filters or geolocation features
5. **No API Access**: Manual operation only, not suitable for automation

#### WebLeads Offers More Value Because:
1. **Comprehensive Data**: Extracts emails, social media, owner names, reviews, ratings
2. **Real-time Scraping**: Fresh data vs potentially cached results
3. **Advanced Features**: Website audits, SEO analysis, social presence analysis
4. **Multiple Data Sources**: Google Maps + YellowPages, Bing, Facebook, LinkedIn
5. **Outreach Automation**: Built-in email sequencing and follow-ups
6. **API Access**: Programmatic access for automation and integration
7. **Scalability**: Cloud-based platform vs browser extension limitations
8. **Support**: Professional support vs community-only

#### True Cost Comparison
- **Map Lead Scraper**: $9.90/month = $0.099 per 1,000 basic leads (limited data)
- **WebLeads**: Quota-based pricing — Starter $29/mo (1 search/day, 800 results/search, 50 DM unlocks, 500 verifications); Growth $79/mo (3/day, 1,500 results, 200 DM, 2,000 verifications). Top-ups from $2 (DM) / $4 (verifications), 6-month validity.
- **Value Difference**: WebLeads provides full data, decision-makers, and pay-per-success verification at transparent quota-based pricing

#### Market Position
Budget option for users who only need basic contact information and are comfortable with manual, browser-based operation. Not suitable for serious lead generation or business automation needs.
